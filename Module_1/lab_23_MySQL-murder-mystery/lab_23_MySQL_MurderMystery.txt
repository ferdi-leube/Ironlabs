For some reason, everytime I added new statements on the query of the website, it only executed the first statement.
I therefore had to delete my previous statment every single time and have no query to show, but:

Here are my results:

Murderer: Jeremy Bowers
Vilian: Miranda Priestly

I mainly used different select statements, often also joining them with the union statement when I had multiple witness information
located in different tables.
